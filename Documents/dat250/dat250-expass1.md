## DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1
---

### Technical problems 
I did not encounter any problems when installing the software development environment, from previous courses i had JDK, IDE(IntelliJ) and Git installed.
The installation of Maven was pretty straight forward, I used the windows installer and added the filepath to system variables to be able to run it from command line.

### Validation of software installation 
The validation of the software development was done by checking the installation with commands like:\
git --version  
mvn -v  
java -version  

### Technical problems with heroku

The tutorial was easy to follow and everything went well, I did not register a credit card so i was not able to verify my account so i skipped the part with addons.
